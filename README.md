# Fixate Themes README

A somewhat muted set of adaptive themes and color schemes for Sublime Text. The adaptive color schemes are principally based on the default adaptive them, but with some tweaks. One of these includes a gray-blue tinted theme. The color themes include black, blackish (to reduce contrast), gray, and light (which uses a white background).

The themes include icons principally based on the FileIcons package.
